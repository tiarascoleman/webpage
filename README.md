# Webpage
This is the first webpage I created in order to master in understanding the Frontend Trinity knowns (HTML/CSS/Javascript). I choose the topic of fashion because the colors are so fun and I am ever becoming obessed with fashion!

I credit Colt Steele who created a series on Youtube known as HTML/CSS/Javascript Series that aided in the creation of the website! Thanks so much love! :)
